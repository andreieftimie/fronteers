Fronteers
=========

2012 Atendees list ( http://fronteers.nl/congres/2012/attendees ) has no stats
on how many atendees there are from each country. Wanting to visualize them,
I've scraped the website with Yahoo's *YQL* parsed the data and created a pie with *Raphael*

You can now easily see that over 50% are still Dutch http://andreieftimie.github.com/fronteers/

I am aiming to take some historical data and put this into perspective. Expect more stats :)
